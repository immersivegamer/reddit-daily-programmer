Eolutions for challenges from the Reddit subreddit /r/dailyprogrammer

Each difficulty will be in it's own folder of easy, intermeditae, hard or weekly.

Each challenge will be in it's own folder with format of '[number] - description', for example:

    /hard/321 - circle

Solutions will either have the challenge inputs in the solution or in a file next to the solution. Running the solution should output the results without any additional inputs. Solutions will have the link to the challenge page in them. If there are multiple languages used for a challenge, solutions may be in their own folder.
